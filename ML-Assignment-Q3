# 3: Are Correlation, Cosine similarity, and Euclidean distance functions defined in SciPy AND Pandas?
# If there are, please give another version of the above code by calling them directly.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine
from scipy.spatial import distance
import random


# define two lists or array
point1 = np.array([26,34,52,44,81])
point2 = np.array([22,44,55,23,23])
print("point1 :", point1)
print("point2 :", point2)

# Create Pandas Series from the vectors
x1 = pd.Series(point1)
x2 = pd.Series(point2)

# Calculate correlation
correlation = x1.corr(x2)
print("Correlation:", correlation)

# compute cosine similarity
similarity = 1 - cosine(point1, point2)
print("Cosine similarity:", similarity)

# Calculate Euclidean distance
euclidean_distance = distance.euclidean(x1, x2)
print("Euclidean Distance:", euclidean_distance)
